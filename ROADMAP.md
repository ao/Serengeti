2. Enhance cost-based optimization with improved cost models
3. Add support for additional SQL features in the query parser
4. Implement query result caching

### Long-term (1-2 months)

1. Implement distributed query execution with parallel processing
2. Add adaptive query parallelization
3. Implement cross-region query optimization
4. Enhance the monitoring dashboard with query performance metrics

## Conclusion

The Serengeti project has made significant progress in implementing core functionality and performance optimizations. The Query Execution Optimization component is well underway, with 75% completion across its key areas. The focus for the next development phase should be on completing the Query Execution Optimization component, followed by security enhancements and scalability improvements.
