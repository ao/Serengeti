# StorageScheduler Error Handling Strategy

This document outlines the error handling strategy implemented in the StorageScheduler component of the Serengeti system.

## Overview

The StorageScheduler is responsible for periodically persisting database state to disk, which is a critical operation for data durability. The enhanced error handling strategy makes the system more resilient and better able to recover from failures.

## Error Classification

Errors in the StorageScheduler are classified into two main categories:

### 1. Transient Errors

Transient errors are temporary issues that may resolve themselves on retry:

- Network connectivity issues (connection reset, connection refused)
- Temporary resource constraints (too many open files)
- Temporary disk space issues
- Brief I/O contention

### 2. Persistent Errors

Persistent errors are more serious issues that are unlikely to resolve without intervention:

- Permission denied errors
- File not found errors
- Disk corruption
- Permanent disk full conditions
- Out of memory errors

## Error Handling Mechanisms

### Retry Logic

The StorageScheduler implements a retry mechanism for transient errors:

- Maximum of 3 retry attempts for transient errors
- Exponential backoff between retries (1s, 2s, 3s)
- No retries for persistent errors

### Transaction-like Behavior

To ensure data consistency, the StorageScheduler implements transaction-like behavior:

1. **Preparation Phase**: All operations are prepared and validated before execution
2. **Execution Phase**: Operations are executed in order
3. **Rollback Mechanism**: If a critical operation fails, previous operations may be rolled back

### Graceful Degradation

The system is designed to degrade gracefully when errors occur:

- Non-critical errors don't stop the entire persistence process
- Critical errors trigger appropriate alerts while maintaining system stability
- The system tracks its health status and can report when it's in a degraded state

## Error Metrics and Monitoring

The StorageScheduler collects detailed error metrics:

- Total error count
- Transient vs. persistent error counts
- Error type distribution
- Health status indicator

These metrics can be accessed programmatically via the `getErrorMetrics()` method.

## Logging Strategy

Enhanced logging provides detailed context for troubleshooting:

- Operation start and completion events
- Detailed error information including context
- Retry attempts and outcomes
- Transaction state changes

## Common Error Scenarios and Troubleshooting

### Disk Full Errors

**Symptoms:**
- Persistence operations fail with "No space left on device" errors
- Error metrics show persistent I/O errors

**Resolution:**
1. Free up disk space
2. Check disk quotas
3. Verify disk health

### Permission Denied Errors

**Symptoms:**
- Persistence operations fail with "Permission denied" errors
- Error metrics show persistent AccessDeniedException

**Resolution:**
1. Check file and directory permissions
2. Verify user permissions
3. Check for locked files

### Network Connectivity Issues

**Symptoms:**
- Intermittent failures with "Connection reset" or "Connection refused" errors
- Error metrics show transient I/O errors

**Resolution:**
1. Check network connectivity
2. Verify firewall settings
3. Monitor network stability

### Out of Memory Errors

**Symptoms:**
- System crashes with OutOfMemoryError
- Health status reports unhealthy

**Resolution:**
1. Increase JVM heap size
2. Review memory usage patterns
3. Consider database size limits

## Best Practices

1. **Regular Monitoring**: Check error metrics regularly to identify patterns
2. **Proactive Maintenance**: Address persistent errors promptly
3. **Resource Planning**: Ensure adequate disk space and memory
4. **Backup Strategy**: Implement regular backups as additional protection

## Implementation Details

The error handling strategy is implemented in the `StorageScheduler` class:

- `performPersistToDisk()`: Main method with enhanced error handling
- `executeOperations()`: Handles transaction-like behavior
- `isTransientError()`: Determines if an error can be retried
- `recordError()`: Tracks error metrics
- `isHealthy()`: Reports health status
- `getErrorMetrics()`: Provides error statistics

## Future Improvements

Potential future enhancements to the error handling strategy:

1. Circuit breaker pattern for external dependencies
2. More sophisticated rollback mechanisms
3. Automated recovery procedures
4. Integration with external monitoring systems
5. Predictive error detection
