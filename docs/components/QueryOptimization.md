# Serengeti Query Optimization System

This document provides an overview of the Query Optimization system in the Serengeti distributed database.

## Overview

The Query Optimization system improves query performance by analyzing queries, generating efficient execution plans, and leveraging statistics and caching. It consists of several components that work together to optimize query execution.

## Key Components

### 1. Statistics Manager

The `StatisticsManager` collects and maintains statistics about tables and columns to support cost-based query optimization:

- **Table Statistics**: Row counts, average row sizes, and other table-level metrics
- **Column Statistics**: Distinct value counts, value distributions, min/max values, and other column-level metrics
- **Periodic Collection**: Statistics are collected periodically to ensure they remain current
- **Manual Collection**: Statistics can also be collected on-demand

```java
// Example of using StatisticsManager
StatisticsManager statsManager = StatisticsManager.getInstance();
statsManager.collectTableStatistics("mydb", "mytable");
TableStatistics tableStats = statsManager.getTableStatistics("mydb", "mytable");
ColumnStatistics colStats = statsManager.getColumnStatistics("mydb", "mytable", "id");
```

### 2. Query Plan Generator

The `QueryPlanGenerator` creates and evaluates alternative query execution plans based on statistics and cost estimates:

- **Plan Generation**: Creates multiple candidate plans for a query
- **Cost Estimation**: Estimates the cost of each plan based on statistics
- **Plan Selection**: Selects the plan with the lowest estimated cost
- **Plan Representation**: Represents plans as a sequence of operations

```java
// Example of using QueryPlanGenerator
QueryPlanGenerator planGenerator = QueryPlanGenerator.getInstance();
QueryPlan plan = planGenerator.generateSelectPlan(
    "mydb", "mytable", "*", "id", "123", "=");
```

### 3. Query Plan Executor

The `QueryPlanExecutor` executes query plans generated by the query optimizer:

- **Plan Execution**: Translates abstract plans into concrete operations
- **Operation Execution**: Executes each operation in the plan
- **Result Collection**: Collects and processes results
- **Execution Metrics**: Tracks execution time and other metrics

```java
// Example of using QueryPlanExecutor
QueryPlanExecutor executor = QueryPlanExecutor.getInstance();
List<String> results = executor.execute(plan);
```

### 4. Query Cache

The `QueryCache` provides caching functionality for query results to improve performance for frequently executed queries:

- **Result Caching**: Caches query results for reuse
- **Cache Invalidation**: Invalidates cache entries when data changes
- **Cache Management**: Manages cache size and entry lifetime
- **Cache Statistics**: Tracks cache hits, misses, and other metrics

```java
// Example of using QueryCache
QueryCache cache = QueryCache.getInstance();
String cacheKey = QueryCache.generateCacheKey("mydb", "mytable", "*", "id", "123", "=");
List<String> cachedResult = cache.getQueryResult(cacheKey);
```

### 5. Prepared Statements

The `PreparedStatement` class represents pre-compiled SQL statements that can be executed multiple times with different parameter values:

- **Statement Preparation**: Pre-compiles statements for repeated use
- **Parameter Binding**: Allows binding different parameter values
- **Plan Reuse**: Reuses query plans for improved performance
- **Result Caching**: Caches results for specific parameter values

```java
// Example of using PreparedStatement
PreparedStatement stmt = PreparedStatement.create(
    "select * from mydb.mytable where id = ?",
    Arrays.asList("?"),
    "mydb", "mytable", "*", "id", "=");
List<String> results = stmt.execute(new Object[]{"123"});
```

## Query Optimization Process

The query optimization process consists of the following steps:

### 1. Query Parsing

The query string is parsed to extract key components:
- Database and table names
- Selected columns
- Filter conditions
- Join conditions
- Other query elements

### 2. Statistics Lookup

The optimizer looks up statistics for the tables and columns involved in the query:
- Table row counts
- Column value distributions
- Index availability
- Other relevant statistics

### 3. Plan Generation

Multiple candidate execution plans are generated:
- Full table scan plans
- Index scan plans
- Join plans (for multi-table queries)
- Other specialized plans

### 4. Cost Estimation

The cost of each plan is estimated based on statistics:
- I/O cost (number of pages to read)
- CPU cost (amount of processing required)
- Memory usage
- Network transfer cost (for distributed queries)

### 5. Plan Selection

The plan with the lowest estimated cost is selected for execution.

### 6. Plan Execution

The selected plan is executed:
- Operations are performed in sequence
- Results are collected and processed
- Execution metrics are recorded

### 7. Result Caching

The query results are cached for future reuse (if caching is enabled).

## Optimization Levels

The Query Optimization system supports different optimization levels:

- **NONE**: No optimization - use the original query execution path
- **LOW**: Basic optimizations like index usage
- **MEDIUM**: Index usage, join order optimization, etc.
- **HIGH**: All available optimizations including statistics-based decisions
- **EXPERIMENTAL**: Includes experimental features that may not be stable

## Query Optimization Commands

The following commands can be used to control the query optimization system:

- `optimization status`: Show the current optimization status
- `optimization enable`: Enable query optimization
- `optimization disable`: Disable query optimization
- `optimization level <level>`: Set the optimization level (NONE, LOW, MEDIUM, HIGH, EXPERIMENTAL)
- `cache enable`: Enable query caching
- `cache disable`: Disable query caching
- `cache clear`: Clear the query cache
- `cache stats`: Show cache statistics
- `statistics collect`: Manually collect statistics

## Performance Impact

The Query Optimization system can significantly improve query performance:

- **Index Usage**: Using indexes can reduce the number of rows scanned
- **Join Optimization**: Optimizing join order can reduce intermediate result sizes
- **Query Caching**: Caching results can eliminate query execution for repeated queries
- **Statistics-based Decisions**: Using statistics can lead to better execution plans

## Best Practices

1. **Keep Statistics Updated**: Ensure statistics are up-to-date for optimal plan generation
2. **Create Appropriate Indexes**: Create indexes on columns frequently used in WHERE, JOIN, and ORDER BY clauses
3. **Use Prepared Statements**: Use prepared statements for frequently executed queries
4. **Monitor Cache Performance**: Monitor cache hit rates and adjust cache settings accordingly
5. **Choose Appropriate Optimization Level**: Select the optimization level based on your workload

## Future Enhancements

1. **Advanced Join Optimization**: More sophisticated join order optimization
2. **Adaptive Query Processing**: Adjusting plans during execution based on runtime statistics
3. **Machine Learning Optimization**: Using machine learning to predict optimal plans
4. **Distributed Query Optimization**: Better optimization for queries spanning multiple nodes
5. **Automatic Index Recommendation**: Suggesting indexes based on query patterns

## Conclusion

The Query Optimization system in Serengeti provides powerful tools for improving query performance. By leveraging statistics, generating efficient execution plans, and caching results, it can significantly reduce query execution time and resource usage.
