# Serengeti Query Engine

This document provides an overview of the Query Engine component in the Serengeti distributed database system.

## Overview

The Query Engine is responsible for parsing, planning, optimizing, and executing queries against the Serengeti database. It serves as the bridge between client requests and the underlying data storage, providing a SQL-like interface for data manipulation and retrieval.

## Key Components

### 1. QueryEngine

The `QueryEngine` class is the main entry point for query processing. It:

- Parses query strings into executable plans
- Optimizes query execution paths
- Executes queries against the storage layer
- Returns results to clients

```java
// Example of QueryEngine usage
String query = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE age > 30";
QueryResponseObject response = QueryEngine.executeQuery(query);
```

### 2. QueryLog

The `QueryLog` component records information about executed queries for:

- Performance analysis
- Query pattern detection
- Automatic indexing decisions
- Debugging and troubleshooting

```java
// Example of QueryLog usage
QueryLog.recordQuery(query, executionTime, resultCount);
List<QueryLogEntry> recentQueries = QueryLog.getRecentQueries(10);
```

### 3. QueryResponseObject

The `QueryResponseObject` class encapsulates query results and metadata:

- Result data rows
- Execution statistics
- Error information (if applicable)
- Explanation of query execution plan

```java
// Example of QueryResponseObject usage
QueryResponseObject response = QueryEngine.executeQuery(query);
if (response.isSuccess()) {
    List<Map<String, Object>> results = response.getResults();
    long executionTime = response.getExecutionTime();
    String explain = response.getExplain();
} else {
    String errorMessage = response.getErrorMessage();
}
```

## Query Processing Pipeline

The Query Engine processes queries through the following pipeline:

### 1. Parsing

The query string is parsed into an abstract syntax tree (AST) that represents the query structure:

- Lexical analysis breaks the query into tokens
- Syntax analysis builds the AST
- Semantic validation ensures the query is valid

### 2. Query Planning

The query planner creates an execution plan:

- Determines tables and indexes to access
- Plans join operations
- Identifies filter conditions
- Determines projection fields

### 3. Optimization

The optimizer improves the execution plan:

- Reorders operations for efficiency
- Chooses optimal join algorithms
- Decides when to use indexes
- Estimates operation costs

### 4. Execution

The execution engine runs the optimized plan:

- Retrieves data from storage
- Applies filters and transformations
- Performs joins and aggregations
- Collects results

### 5. Result Handling

The results are processed and returned:

- Formatting results according to query requirements
- Collecting execution statistics
- Generating execution explanations
- Creating the response object

## Supported Query Types

The Query Engine supports the following types of queries:

### Data Retrieval

```sql
-- Basic SELECT query
SELECT column1, column2 FROM table;

-- Filtered query
SELECT * FROM table WHERE condition;

-- Joins
SELECT t1.column, t2.column 
FROM table1 t1 
JOIN table2 t2 ON t1.id = t2.id;

-- Aggregation
SELECT column, COUNT(*) 
FROM table 
GROUP BY column;

-- Ordering
SELECT * FROM table ORDER BY column ASC/DESC;

-- Limiting results
SELECT * FROM table LIMIT 10;
```

### Data Manipulation

```sql
-- Insert data
INSERT INTO table (column1, column2) VALUES (value1, value2);

-- Update data
UPDATE table SET column = value WHERE condition;

-- Delete data
DELETE FROM table WHERE condition;
```

### Schema Operations

```sql
-- Create database
CREATE DATABASE database_name;

-- Create table
CREATE TABLE table_name (
  column1 TYPE,
  column2 TYPE
);

-- Create index
CREATE INDEX ON table(column);

-- Drop operations
DROP DATABASE database_name;
DROP TABLE table_name;
DROP INDEX ON table(column);
```

### Transactions

```sql
-- Begin transaction
BEGIN;

-- Multiple operations
INSERT INTO table VALUES (...);
UPDATE other_table SET column = value;

-- Commit or rollback
COMMIT;
-- or
ROLLBACK;
```

## Query Optimization

### Index Utilization

The Query Engine automatically uses indexes when available:

- Equality conditions (`column = value`)
- Range conditions (`column > value`)
- Prefix matching (`column LIKE 'prefix%'`)
- Sorting (`ORDER BY column`)

```sql
-- This query will use an index on 'username' if available
SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = 'johndoe';
```

### Join Optimization

The Query Engine implements several join algorithms:

- **Nested Loop Join**: For small tables or when indexes are available
- **Hash Join**: For equality joins on larger tables
- **Sort-Merge Join**: For sorted data or range conditions

### Query Rewriting

The optimizer may rewrite queries for better performance:

- Pushing down filters to reduce intermediate results
- Reordering joins to minimize result sizes
- Converting subqueries to joins when possible
- Simplifying expressions

### Statistics-based Optimization

The Query Engine uses statistics to make optimization decisions:

- Table sizes
- Column cardinality (number of distinct values)
- Value distributions
- Index statistics

## Distributed Query Processing

For distributed queries across multiple nodes:

### Query Routing

- Determines which nodes contain relevant data
- Routes query fragments to appropriate nodes
- Aggregates results from multiple nodes

### Distributed Joins

- Minimizes data movement between nodes
- Uses co-located joins when possible
- Implements distributed hash joins when necessary

### Result Aggregation

- Combines partial results from multiple nodes
- Performs final aggregations and sorting
- Returns consolidated results to the client

## Integration with Other Components

### Storage Integration

The Query Engine interacts with the Storage component to:
- Retrieve data for queries
- Apply updates from write operations
- Access metadata for query planning

### Index Integration

The Query Engine works with the Indexing System to:
- Determine available indexes for queries
- Use indexes for efficient data access
- Suggest new indexes based on query patterns

### Network Integration

For distributed queries, the Query Engine interacts with the Network component to:
- Coordinate query execution across nodes
- Transfer intermediate results between nodes
- Handle node failures during query execution

## Performance Considerations

### Query Caching

The Query Engine implements caching mechanisms:

- **Result Cache**: Caches results of frequent queries
- **Plan Cache**: Caches execution plans for similar queries
- **Metadata Cache**: Caches table and index metadata

### Parallel Execution

For complex queries, the engine can use parallel execution:

- Parallel scans of large tables
- Parallel processing of independent operations
- Multi-threaded execution of query fragments

### Resource Management

The Query Engine manages resources to prevent overload:

- Query timeout mechanisms
- Memory usage limits
- Concurrent query limits
- Priority-based scheduling

## Monitoring and Troubleshooting

### Query Profiling

The Query Engine provides profiling information:

```sql
-- Get execution plan without running the query
EXPLAIN SELECT * FROM users WHERE age > 30;

-- Get execution plan with runtime statistics
EXPLAIN ANALYZE SELECT * FROM users WHERE age > 30;
```

### Common Issues and Solutions

| Issue | Possible Causes | Solutions |
|-------|----------------|-----------|
| Slow queries | Missing indexes, inefficient joins | Create appropriate indexes, optimize query |
| Out of memory | Large result sets, complex operations | Add LIMIT clause, simplify query, increase memory |
| Timeout errors | Long-running operations | Optimize query, increase timeout, add indexes |
| Incorrect results | Logic errors, data issues | Verify query logic, check data integrity |

## Best Practices

1. **Use Specific Columns**: Select only needed columns instead of `SELECT *`
2. **Add Appropriate Filters**: Include WHERE clauses to limit result sets
3. **Create Proper Indexes**: Index columns used in WHERE, JOIN, and ORDER BY
4. **Limit Result Sets**: Use LIMIT to restrict large result sets
5. **Use Prepared Statements**: For frequently executed queries
6. **Monitor Query Performance**: Regularly check for slow queries

## Future Enhancements

1. **Advanced Query Optimization**: Cost-based optimizer with more sophisticated strategies
2. **Machine Learning Optimization**: Using ML to predict optimal query plans
3. **Materialized Views**: Support for materialized views for complex queries
4. **Query Federation**: Support for querying across different data sources
5. **Stream Processing**: Support for continuous queries on data streams

## Conclusion

The Query Engine is a central component of the Serengeti database system, providing powerful query capabilities while optimizing for performance in a distributed environment. Its integration with other components enables efficient data access and manipulation across the distributed database.
