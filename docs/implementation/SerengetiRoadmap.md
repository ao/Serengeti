# Serengeti Project Roadmap

This document provides a comprehensive roadmap for the Serengeti distributed database system, outlining completed tasks, pending tasks, and a structured implementation plan for future development.

## Executive Summary

The Serengeti project has made significant progress in replacing mock implementations with production-ready code and implementing core functionality. Key achievements include:
