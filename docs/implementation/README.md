# Serengeti Implementation Plans

This directory contains comprehensive implementation plans for improving the Serengeti distributed database system. These plans address various areas that need implementation or enhancement to make the system production-ready.

## Master Implementation Plan

The [Master Implementation Plan](MasterImplementationPlan.md) provides a high-level overview of all improvements, their dependencies, timeline, and resource allocation. It serves as the main coordination document for the implementation effort.

## Component-Specific Implementation Plans

### Core Infrastructure

1. [**Mock Implementation Replacement Plan**](MockImplementationReplacementPlan.md)
   - Replaces mock implementations of Network, Storage, and Server components with real, production-ready implementations
   - Foundational work that enables other improvements
   - Includes detailed plans for each component and their integration

### Query Engine Enhancements

2. [**Advanced Search Implementation Plan**](AdvancedSearchImplementationPlan.md)
   - Implements advanced search features: range queries, full-text search, regex matching, and fuzzy matching
   - Enhances query capabilities for more powerful and flexible data retrieval
   - Includes detailed plans for each search feature and their integration with the query engine

3. [**Query Plan Executor Implementation Plan**](QueryPlanExecutorImplementationPlan.md)
   - Completes the implementation of the Query Plan Executor by adding missing functionality
   - Focuses on the `applySort` and `applyLimit` methods for supporting ORDER BY and LIMIT clauses
   - Includes detailed design, implementation tasks, and testing strategy

### Security Enhancements

4. [**Security Enhancements Implementation Plan**](SecurityEnhancementsImplementationPlan.md)
   - Implements comprehensive security features: authentication, authorization, encryption, audit logging, and security monitoring
   - Transforms the system from relying on network isolation to having robust built-in security
   - Includes detailed plans for each security aspect and their integration with other components

## Implementation Priorities

The implementation priorities are as follows:

1. **Replace Mock Implementations** - This is foundational work that enables other improvements
2. **Complete Query Plan Executor** - This enhances basic query functionality
3. **Implement Advanced Search Features** - This adds powerful search capabilities
4. **Add Security Enhancements** - This makes the system production-ready for sensitive data

## Timeline Overview

The overall implementation is expected to take approximately 8-12 weeks, with the following high-level timeline:

- **Weeks 1-2**: Foundation work (basic network, storage, server implementations)
- **Weeks 3-4**: Core functionality (message passing, storage engine, request routing, basic query features)
- **Weeks 5-6**: Advanced features (failure handling, compaction, web interfaces, advanced search)
- **Weeks 7-8**: Integration and testing (component integration, comprehensive testing, performance optimization)
- **Weeks 9-12**: Security enhancements (authentication, authorization, encryption, audit logging, monitoring)

## Next Steps

1. Review and prioritize the implementation plans
2. Set up development branches and CI/CD pipeline
3. Assign resources to specific components
4. Begin implementation with the mock replacement plan
5. Conduct regular progress reviews and adjust as needed

## Contributing

When implementing these plans:

1. Create a branch for each major component
2. Follow the design and implementation tasks outlined in the plans
3. Develop comprehensive tests alongside implementation
4. Document your work as you progress
5. Submit pull requests for review before merging

## Success Criteria

The implementation will be considered successful when:

1. All mock implementations are replaced with real, production-ready code
2. All advanced search operators are fully implemented and functional
3. The Query Plan Executor is complete with sorting and limiting functionality
4. Security features are implemented and properly integrated
5. All tests pass, including edge cases and performance tests
6. Performance meets or exceeds defined benchmarks
7. Documentation is updated to reflect all implementations
