# Serengeti Mock Implementation Replacement Plan

This document outlines the comprehensive plan for replacing mock implementations with real ones in the Serengeti distributed database system. This work is foundational for the system's production readiness.

## Overview

The Serengeti system currently uses mock implementations for several critical components:
- MockNetwork
- MockStorage
- MockServer

These mock implementations need to be replaced with real, production-ready implementations that provide the actual functionality required by the system.

## Implementation Approach

We'll implement all three components in parallel, with careful attention to their integration points. The implementation will follow these principles:

1. **Interface Compatibility**: Maintain compatibility with existing interfaces to minimize disruption
2. **Incremental Development**: Implement core functionality first, then add advanced features
3. **Comprehensive Testing**: Develop tests alongside implementation to ensure correctness
4. **Performance Optimization**: Focus on efficiency and scalability from the beginning
