# Serengeti Master Implementation Plan

This document provides a comprehensive roadmap for implementing the identified improvements to the Serengeti distributed database system. It integrates the plans for replacing mock implementations with real ones and implementing advanced search features.

## Executive Summary

The Serengeti system requires significant improvements in two key areas:

1. **Replacing Mock Implementations**: The current system uses mock implementations for critical components (Network, Storage, Server) that need to be replaced with real, production-ready implementations.

2. **Implementing Advanced Search Features**: The system documentation describes advanced search capabilities (range queries, full-text search, regex matching, fuzzy matching) that are not yet implemented.

This master plan coordinates these efforts to ensure efficient development, proper integration, and comprehensive testing.

## Implementation Goals

### Primary Goals

1. Replace all mock implementations with production-ready code
2. Implement all documented advanced search features
3. Maintain backward compatibility with existing interfaces
4. Ensure high performance and scalability
5. Provide comprehensive testing for all new implementations

### Success Criteria

1. All mock implementations replaced with real, production-ready code
2. All advanced search operators fully implemented and functional
3. All existing and new tests pass successfully
4. Performance meets or exceeds defined benchmarks
5. Documentation updated to reflect all implementations
