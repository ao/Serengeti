- **Compaction**: Automatic background optimization of storage
- **Scalability**: Well-suited for handling large datasets

### Trade-offs
- **Read Amplification**: Reads may need to check multiple files
- **Space Amplification**: Temporarily uses more space due to compaction
- **Background Processing**: Requires CPU and I/O resources for compaction
- **Complexity**: More complex than simpler storage structures

## B-tree Indexing

### Decision
Serengeti uses B-tree data structures for indexing.

### Rationale
- **Balanced Tree**: Guarantees O(log n) lookup, insertion, and deletion
- **Range Queries**: Efficient for both point lookups and range queries
- **Mature Algorithm**: Well-understood algorithm with predictable performance
- **Memory Efficiency**: Good balance of memory usage and performance

### Trade-offs
- **Write Overhead**: Index updates add overhead to write operations
- **Memory Usage**: Indexes consume additional memory
- **Maintenance Cost**: Indexes must be maintained as data changes

## Background Persistence with StorageScheduler

### Decision
Serengeti uses a background thread (StorageScheduler) to periodically persist database state to disk.

### Rationale
- **Performance**: Allows batching of write operations for better throughput
- **Responsiveness**: Prevents client operations from blocking on disk I/O
- **Resource Efficiency**: Better utilization of I/O resources
- **Consistency**: Provides a consistent point-in-time snapshot of the database

### Trade-offs
- **Potential Data Loss**: Recent changes may be lost if system crashes before persistence
- **Resource Contention**: Background persistence can compete with foreground operations
- **Complexity**: Requires careful error handling and recovery mechanisms

## Automatic Data Replication

### Decision
Serengeti automatically replicates data across multiple nodes in the network.

### Rationale
- **Fault Tolerance**: Ensures data availability even if nodes fail
- **Read Scalability**: Allows distributing read operations across replicas
- **Geographic Distribution**: Can place replicas in different locations
- **Zero Configuration**: Happens automatically without manual intervention

### Trade-offs
- **Write Overhead**: Replication adds latency to write operations
- **Network Usage**: Increases network traffic
- **Consistency Challenges**: Must handle consistency between replicas
- **Storage Overhead**: Multiple copies consume more storage

## HTTP-based Client Interface

### Decision
Serengeti provides an HTTP-based interface for client interactions, including a web dashboard.

### Rationale
- **Accessibility**: Easy to access from any device with a web browser
- **Firewall Friendly**: HTTP traffic typically passes through firewalls
- **Stateless**: Simplifies client-server interaction
- **Visualization**: Web interface allows rich data visualization

### Trade-offs
- **Performance Overhead**: HTTP has higher overhead than binary protocols
- **Limited Streaming**: Less efficient for streaming large result sets
- **Connection Management**: HTTP connection management can be complex

## In-Memory Data Structure with Periodic Persistence

### Decision
Serengeti keeps data primarily in memory with periodic persistence to disk.

### Rationale
- **Performance**: In-memory operations are much faster than disk operations
- **Simplicity**: Simplifies data structure design
- **Responsiveness**: Provides fast response times for queries
- **Batched I/O**: More efficient disk usage through batched writes

### Trade-offs
- **Memory Limitations**: Database size limited by available memory
- **Durability Risk**: Risk of data loss between persistence operations
- **Restart Time**: Longer startup time as data is loaded into memory

## Automatic Node Discovery and Integration

### Decision
Serengeti automatically discovers other instances on the network and integrates them into the distributed system.

### Rationale
- **Zero Configuration**: No manual node registration required
- **Dynamic Scaling**: Easily add capacity by launching new instances
- **Self-healing**: System automatically adapts to nodes joining and leaving
- **Operational Simplicity**: Reduces operational complexity

### Trade-offs
- **Network Overhead**: Discovery mechanisms consume network bandwidth
- **Security Considerations**: Must ensure only authorized nodes can join
- **Coordination Complexity**: Requires careful coordination during node integration
- **Limited Control**: Less control over cluster topology

## Consistent Hashing for Data Distribution

### Decision
Serengeti uses consistent hashing for distributing data across nodes.

### Rationale
- **Minimal Redistribution**: When nodes join or leave, only a fraction of data needs to move
- **Balanced Distribution**: Provides relatively even data distribution
- **Scalability**: Works well as the number of nodes changes
- **Deterministic**: Node for a given key can be determined without central coordination

### Trade-offs
- **Potential Imbalance**: Can lead to some imbalance in data distribution
- **Complexity**: More complex than simple hash-based sharding
- **Virtual Nodes**: Often requires virtual node concept for better balance

## Automatic Indexing

### Decision
Serengeti includes an automatic indexing feature that monitors query patterns and creates indexes for frequently queried columns.

### Rationale
- **Performance Optimization**: Improves query performance without manual intervention
- **Adaptive**: Adjusts to changing query patterns
- **Reduced Management**: Minimizes need for manual index management
- **Resource Efficiency**: Only creates indexes that will be beneficial

### Trade-offs
- **Resource Usage**: Index creation and maintenance consume resources
- **Storage Overhead**: Indexes increase storage requirements
- **Write Performance**: More indexes slow down write operations
- **Potential Misidentification**: May create indexes that aren't optimal

## Future Design Considerations

### Multi-region Support
- **Current Limitation**: Limited to single subnet
- **Future Direction**: Support for multi-region deployment
- **Challenges**: Network latency, partial failures, consistency models

### Enhanced Security

- **Challenges**: Abstraction design, feature compatibility, testing complexity

## Conclusion

The design decisions in Serengeti reflect a focus on autonomy, simplicity, and performance. The system prioritizes ease of use and self-management, making trade-offs that favor operational simplicity over fine-grained control. These decisions have resulted in a distributed database system that requires minimal configuration and management while providing robust distributed functionality.

As the system evolves, some of these design decisions may be revisited to address the limitations and trade-offs identified, particularly in areas such as multi-region support, security, and advanced replication strategies.
